Imagine a pie maker located in Michigan (Central time zone).  Every pie is made to order.  This means there's a delay between when you place your order and when it goes in the mail.  The pie maker only ships three days a week.

Orders placed before 10 am Monday ship on Tuesday at 2pm.
Orders placed before 10 am Tuesday will ship on Wednesday at 2pm
Orders placed before  3 pm Friday will ship on the following Monday at 10am.

Write a program such that:

Given a current date and time in a given time zone, it tells me the Merchant's next order cutoff time, as well as when my pie will ship.

Please write your implementation in Ruby and include some unit tests.
